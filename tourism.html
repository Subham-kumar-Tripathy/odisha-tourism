        <h2 class="heading" >History  Of Kalinga </h2>
        <p class="hhh">
            Odisha, also known as Orissa, is a largely populated State of India..
            The climate of Odisha is tropical.largest in the world. It is a favourite haunt for migratory birds from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, the Aral Sea and other remote parts of Russia, Central and South-east Asia, Ladakh and the Himalayas. Odisha, as a State of Indian Republic, is governed through a system of representative democracy with the Chief Minister and the cabinet from the Legislative Assembly. The Governor is the titular head appointed by President of India. The Assembly is unicameral with 147 elected members including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. It runs for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Local elected bodies known as Panchayats govern local affairs. The State contributes 21 seats to Lok Sabha and 10 seats to Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament. Bhubaneswar is the capital city of Odisha.  The economy of Odisha depends on both agricultural and industrial growth. The rice belt is mainly on the alluvial plains on the coastal part of the State. It has abundant natural resources too. It contains a fifth of India’s coal, a quarter of its iron ore, a third of its bauxite reserves and most of the chromite.
             <br> <br>
            Rourkela Steel Plant was the first integrated steel plant in the public sector in India, built in collaboration with Germany. It has developed unprecedented investments in steel, aluminium, power, refineries and ports. Paradip is the best deep water port in Odisha.  Odisha has a network of roads, railways, airports and seaports. Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, is well connected by air, rail and road with the rest of India. Some highways are getting expanded to four lanes. However, flood and cyclone are the major hurdles in Odisha’s development as all the important districts are situated near the Bay of Bengal.

        <br> <br>
       There are a number of such monuments that are only historically famous but also have a religious significance. Puri is well known for a 12th century temple called 'Jagannath' erected in honor of Hindu god Vishnu. It was begun by king Chodagangadeva and completed by king Ananga Mhima Deva III, It is a very vast temple-awesome and stunning in its structure. The main temple is divided into four parts. The first one is as described the Biman In front of the Biman in a line are the shorter temples called Mukhasala, Jagamohan and Bhogamandap. Surrounding the temple on all sides within the rectangular complex comprising an area of about 10 acres enclosed by two rectangular huge and thick walls, are about 40 or more different temples.

        <h2 class="heading">Konark</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="hhh">
        In the small city of Konark, rests one of the most unique and iconic religious monuments of India - the Konark Sun Temple. Built during the 13th century under the rule of Narasimhadeva I, this imposing Hindu shrine is an amazing example of ancient Kalinga architecture and engineering.
Architecture and symbolism behind a giant chariot.There are 12 pairs of three-meter-diameter wheels carved on the bottom lateral sides of the audience hall structure (Jaga mohan), while the dance hall structure in front (Nata mandir) faces East to receive sunrise's first rays of light. 
<br> <br>
Khondalite rock was used to erect the temple. The structural scheme pays homage to Surya - the Hindu Sun god - whose figurative representation consists of a chariot pulled by seven horses. The wheels are particularly interesting: each one exhibits impressively intricate carvings that can reveal the exact hour of the day down to the minute. These giant wheels are high-precision sundials.

The base of the tower measures about 56 feet inside. It rises vertically to a height of about 50 feet when the contours of the structure begin to incline slightly inwards and produces, at the height of 125 feet.

There is also a mention of this temple in the Brahma Purana which is a revered scripture of the Hindu religion

    <p class="hhh">
        The Rajarani temple, Bhubaneswar (Lat.200 15’ N Long. 850 50’ E) in the district of Khurda is located towards north-east of Lingaraj temple is one of the most beautiful temples representing a unique experiment in the field of architecture in Orissa. The temple, in all probability, referred to in the traditional sanskrit texts as Indresvara Siva temple is remarkable for its sculptural excellence, profusion of ornaments, exuberant architectural features and multiple scroll work. At present, the sanctum is devoid of any deity. The present name Rajarani has been derived from a very fine grained yellowish sand stone called Rajarania in common parlance with which the entire edifice has been built. Mellowed by time, the glaring amber of the stone complements its architectural splendor.
      <br> <br>
        Facing east, this temple consists of a sanctum (deul) with height of 17.9m and a porch (jagamohana) raised above a platform of three mouldings is pancharatha in plan with a curvilinear superstructure (rekha sikhara), reminiscent of the Kandariya Mahadeva temple of Khajuraho.

    </div>
    <p class="hhh">
        The Peace Pagoda built by the Kalinga Nippon Budha Sangha in 1973 and known as Shanti Stupa commemorates the change of heart of Emperor. Ashoka had a special weakness for Dhauli, where the battle was fought. The Daya river is said to have turned red with the blood of the many deceased after the battle, and enabled Ashoka to realize the magnitude of horror associated with war. He saw to it that Dhauli became an important centre of Buddhist activities. He built several chaityas, stupas and pillars there. He got abodes excavated for the recluse, instructions inscribed for officials, expounded the main principles of dandaniti for the public, provided special status to his new kingdom including the stupas at Dhauli.

        The name 'Cuttack' is derived from the anglicised Sanskrit word 'Kataka', meaning military camp or seat of government. It also means the fort, referring to the ancient Barabati Fort, around which the city developed. Cuttack used to be the former capital of Odisha before the title passed on to Bhubaneswar, located about 25 km away. From pretty landscapes to a variety of activities, there is something here for everyone  be it a lover of shopping, history, archaeology or spirituality. One can visit Cuttack at any time of the year, but winter is considered to be the ideal time. Cuttack is the second-largest city in the state of Odisha and the headquarters of the Cuttack District. Its history goes back a 1,000 years and that is why it is also known as the Millennium City. Sometimes it is referred to as Silver City because of the beautiful filigree works made here.

        <h2 class="heading">Koraput</h2>
       </div>
       <p class="hhh">
        Koraput, a land blessed with incredible nature and innocence had always been a dream destination for me. It sports an endless vista filled with greenery, wildflowers, waterfalls and dense forests, everything that a nature lover would drool over.
     The air is so clean that it almost tastes sweet and the views are completely free of any kinds of distractions. Most of Koraput is clear, pure, and exactly as nature had created it without any human adornment.
    <br> <br>
    Despite being smack in the middle of Monsoon, Jeypore, the biggest town of Koraput welcomed us with a beautiful sunny day. The sky was deep blue and completely clear of haze, a sight I had not imagined to see in this trip. Though later on during the day we faced lashing rain and thunder, at this point it all seemed perfect. After a hot cup of tea, and a plate of steaming upma, we started our drive to explore the stunning district of Koraput.
